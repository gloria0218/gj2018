    <p> My name is Gloria Jaramillo and I am currently a student at S.T.E.M. Early College High School. 
    I was born February 18, 2000 in San Antonio, Texas. 
    My favorite sports team is the San Antonio Spurs. 
    I have a few hobbies that include working out at the gym, taking care of my dogs, and focusing on school. 
    After I"m finished with high school I want to study kinesiology to become a physical therapist.</p>
